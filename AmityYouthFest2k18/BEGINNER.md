## Worried about attending your first hackathon? 
Hackathons can sound scary but really they’re fun and relaxed events where you can learn how to create cool technology.
Hackathons are 24+ hour technology festivals. They’re somewhere you can meet like-minded people, learn new things, and create cool technology. They can sound pretty intimidating but you don’t have to be some sort of genius or a coding pro to take part.

## What do I do at a hackathon?
When you turn up to a hackathon, you’re going to be greeted by a bunch of friendly students who are above all passionate about learning. There will be 50 or more participants. There’ll be some volunteers and organizers ready to sign you in, hand you some complimentary goodies, and answer any questions you might have.

First thing you probably want to do is put your bags somewhere and chat to some new people while you wait for the opening ceremony to begin. Hackathons are very much a social event. So don’t waste any opportunity to talk to somebody. The organizers will come up and tell you a bit about the event and what’s planned.

Then hacking begins. You’ll team up with some other students to have fun making something cool. You can make anything you want using whatever technology you want. And it doesn’t have to be to win a prize. Hackathons aren’t really about winning prizes. They’re about playing with awesome technology.

You’ll be able to spend a full 24 hours working on your project if you so desire. But you can take a break to eat some of the  meals and snacks in provision and grab some sleep. There’s usually some fun activities so everyone can have a nice break from working.

It will be a crazy rush to get your project finished. There will be last-minute bugs everywhere. But eventually you’ll have to call it a day. Hacking’s over and it’s demo time.

Everybody will demo their hacks in an auditorium in front of everybody else. It doesn’t matter if your hack doesn’t work properly or if you think your hack is dumb, it’s a chance to share what you learned over the weekend. And it’s so cool seeing what everyone else made.

## Why should I go to a hackathon?
There are three big reasons hackathons are awesome.

1. Hackathons are for learning
You’ll gain more practical knowledge in one hackathon than you learn in a month of lectures. People say this all the time. Hackathons are a super-condensed learning experience. You learn about idea generation, working with others, managing a project, how to use the libraries, frameworks, and APIs that are used by software engineers every day, how to work to a deadline, how to debug, how to do version control, how to deploy, how to test and improve your work, how to present your work on stage, and much more. When you work with others, you’re going to pick up so many new tips and tricks. These are all skills which will make you a better developer and these are all skills which will help you get a job/internship.

2. Hackathons are for meeting people
You’re going to make some new friends. If you’re into tech or making stuff, you’re going to love the inventive, smart, fun people you meet at hackathons. It’s a fantastic place to share ideas, learn from others, and build connections.

Speaking of building connections, hackathons are like career fairs on steroids. If you’re looking for an internship or a job in the tech industry, guess where companies are recruiting? At hackathons of course! Unlike career fairs, you have a proper chance to meet the developers. You can spend a weekend with them, learning from them, showing them your work, and making an impression.

3. Hackathon is free of cost
You don’t need to pay for accommodation.
Also, likelihood is you’re going to walk away with some cool free t-shirts, stickers, or prizes.

Beginners are most welcome.
You shouldn’t be scared of hackathons if you are a beginner.
Mint developers are often worried about whether or not they’ll fit in. Fact is you don’t have to be a coding master to take part and have a good time.

## Refer this FAQ:

### What if I don’t know how to code?
No problem! Complete beginners come at every hackathon. If you’ve never coded before, it’s a great opportunity to spend start learning. You’ll be surrounded by experienced coders, willing to help you out. Coding can look pretty difficult, but actually it’s easy to get started. You can go here and begin right now if you’d like.


### Will I annoy people if I ask them questions?
You’re not going to annoy anybody! These events are wholly centred around learning and having fun. You’re meant to go and ask questions. Everybody will be willing to listen to your questions and help you learn new things. There will also be mentors from some top companies who are there to listen to questions and help you out.

If you can’t find somebody to help you out, go ask the volunteers. If they can’t help you themselves, they’ll help find you somebody who can.

### What if I don’t know anybody there?
Not to worry! You’ll meet people when you get there. Everybody’s very friendly. A lot of people go to hackathons without teams. So it’s perfectly normal to go around to people, tell them you’re looking for a team, and ask if you can help out.

Hackathons will often run team-matching sessions at the start to help you meet people. And you can often join social groups for the event beforehand and post there to find potential teammates.
Invite your friends to come to the hackathon too! That way you’re guaranteed to have at least one familiar face.

### What if I don’t have an idea?
That’s normal. Most people don’t have an idea before they get to the event. But once you start talking to other people, you might come up with something. You can also work with somebody else on their idea if you like it. And there will be prizes at the event which might help give you some ideas. Don’t worry about it, you’ll find something to work on.

### What if I don’t want to present my hack?
You might think your hack isn’t impressive enough to present or you might think it won’t win a prize so why bother? Don’t be silly. Hackathons aren’t about winning prizes. And they aren’t about showing off. They’re about learning and playing with technology. There is absolutely no reason not to share what you’ve been working on for the past 24 hours. Even if your hack doesn’t work or you couldn’t finish it, people like hearing about what you tried to do, what challenges you faced, what technology you used, and what you learned.
